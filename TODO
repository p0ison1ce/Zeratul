Current Todos for Zeratul:

	Easy stuff:
	
	 - Fix the bug on startup. Or actually its not a bug. 
	   Just a slow connection to the iDevice.

	Advanced stuff:
 
	 - Instead of using a iRecovery encrypted. Why not just
	   implement iRecovery into Zeratul. This can be done by
	   using MobileDevice-vb by @fallensn0w. But the file upload
	   isnt supported.
	  
	 - Implement iRecovery Shell. This could be advanced to do
	   or just really easy. It depends on the developers way.

	Zeratul - GUI for iRecovery Strikes Back! :)
---------------------------------------------------------------

A better and much more smaller version of giRecovery!
I wanted to rewrite giRecovery since the code was so
messed up and all that shit. The GUI wasn't really
clean either so i added some minor tweeks to Zeratul.

And since i didn't want radio buttons and all that stuff
i implemented code prefix before typing command in Zeratul.
Take a look below and you'll understand Zeratul very well!

ATUHOR: Fallensn0w
DATE:   2010-08-09
FINISH: 2010-08-09 ( Still in beta progress )
NOTE:   Yes, i took the name ''Zeratul'' from StarCraft series.
	    That's  becuase he's one of my favourites and i thought
	    it would like suit this appliation with name of Zeratul.
GOAL:	Remaking giRecovery and make it more cleaner to use.
		And improving other stuff like speed.
BUGS:   When starting, i had to make the output window visible.
		That is because the program is initializing everything.
		But its so shortly that you dont mind it. :)
